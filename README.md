This is my herbstlufwm config

It is heavily "inspired"(stolen) by the configs that sit at https://github.com/vifino/.files/tree/master/.config/herbstluftwm

Dependencies include:

dzen2
My statusbar at https://gitlab.com/spookykidmm/spookybar
clipmenu
rofi
terminator
light
pamixer
feh
compton
oblogout-fork-git

The "install" script will help you get it all set up(more like my system)
